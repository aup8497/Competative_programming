//newly learnt things in c++

#always use `using namespace std;` no matter what
#'endl' can be used instead '\n'
#while defining a class's method outside a class we use the scope resolution operator :: 
	i.e
		#include <iostream>
		using namespace std;
		class Line
		{
			public:
			double length;
			void setLength( double len );
			double getLength( void );
		};
		// Member functions definitions
		double Line::getLength(void)
		{
			return length ;
		}

# but while extending a subclass from a super class we use           :      (colon)
#we can input two or more variables using `cin >> x >> y`
#every member of a class by default will have private access specifier
#after definition of a class block use ;
#after definition of a method dont use ;
#to use string functions as in c for char array use 
`#include<cstring>`
#to include string as a class (as in java)use `#include<string>`
#Always use public access specifier because by default it is private and you cant acces it in main if main is outside the class

#`this` is not a reference it's a pointer 
#in C++ when you're using `this` keyword unlike in JAVA you should use this->member (and not this.member)  
#`static variables`(for objects) can't be defined inside the class ,it should always be defined outside the class itself using the resolution opertator :: to specify ehich class it belongs to
